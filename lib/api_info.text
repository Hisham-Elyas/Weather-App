Air Quality Data
Air Quality data is returned in the Forecast API and Realtime API response. Depending upon your subscription plan we provide current and 3 day air quality data for the given location in json and xml.

It provides air quality index (see below) data on major pollutant gases like Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), PM 2.5 and PM 10.

By default air quality data is not returned. To get air quality data back in the response from Forecast API and Realtime API, pass the parameter aqi=yes.

Field Data Type Description

o3 float Ozone (μg/m3)
no2 float Nitrogen dioxide (μg/m3)
so2 float Sulphur dioxide (μg/m3)
pm2_5 float PM2.5 (μg/m3)
pm10 float PM10 (μg/m3)

Bulk Request
If you are on Pro+, Business or Enterprise plan then you may use our bulk weather option to send multiple locations to get weather for all the locations sent in a single request.

Each location sent in bulk operation is counted as 1 call. It works for all the API methods except Search API.

For bulk you need to pass in the querysting q=bulk and then pass a json body with utf-8 encoding. All the the other request parameters will be passed as query as usual.

Json format for sending multiple locations in the body.

{
    "locations": [
        {
            "q": "53,-0.12",
            "custom_id": "my-id-1"
        },
        {
            "q": "London",
            "custom_id": "any-internal-id"
        },
        {
            "q": "90201",
            "custom_id": "us-zipcode-id-765"
        }
    ]
}

Json format explanation
Parameter Description
q (required) You may pass lat and lon, US zipcode, UK postcode, city name, IP, etc.
custom_id (optional) We will return this custom_id back in the response for you to use it at your end. It is for better management at your end. We don't use this id for anything.
